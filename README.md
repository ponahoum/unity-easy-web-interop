TODO: 

- Callbacks might not be correctly freed in garbage collector. Confirm and fix
- Improve typescript types generations (ugly code for now, lacks some types, especially for delegates)
- All static types under their namespace ?
- Add utilities JS method to ts ()
- Better support for arrays in the js side, GetElementAt(i) direct call in ts etc.
